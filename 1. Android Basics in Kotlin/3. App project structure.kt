/*
    Gradle is the automated build system used by Android Studio. 
    Whenever you change code, add a resource, or make other changes to your app, Gradle figures out what has changed and takes the necessary steps to rebuild your app. 
    It also installs your app in the emulator or physical device and controls its execution.
